// Package apfel provides an application context implementation with the support
// of "mixins" â€“ services which may be used in the context of "dependency injection".
// "Dependency injection" means the ability not to pass all services dependency directly
// for initialization, but instead implementing a Mixin interface and
// calling MixinApp.Use in Mixin.Include implementation in order to get (or create)
// a mixin dependency from application context.
